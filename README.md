# AdaptiveControlSim

- how to use this simulation

  First of all, the software environments are as follows:

  - Operating System: Windows/MacOS
  - Simulation and Numerical Computation: Matlab2015b /2016b(At the same time, you must install the Simulink module)

  Then, run the MRAC_params.m

  At last, there will display two figures, which represent the state tracking error, and identification model switching signals.

- the application of the simulation

  This numerical simulation focus on the aero-engine control field. Actually, if the form of the controlled plant(objected) satisfies:

  â€‹                                 dot x = A*x + B*u+d

  the simulation can also run ideally.
